# Path Explorer: Probabilistic Roadmap


This is an implementation of the UAV's local path planner
 based on the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) technique. The path planner constructs a safe and short flying path between each pair of sequenced waypoints. I implement a highly parallel version of the PRM based path planner, specifically targeted for GPUs.
